# RockeMap-BasicBot
This is a simple webhook modification, along with a simple-n-single file bot, and 
also using 2 external files for Pokemon Name, and Pokemon Movesets

You can modify your RocketMap (pogom/webhook.py) and add the blocks of scripts I used (starting with a wide/loud comment), 
or (RAW) copy this file and paste it into your webhook.py file.

-I am not a python expert so I bet there are people out there that can make something better.

# How it works?
First, create a channel for all the information pushed by webhook. Only allowing you and your bot access to it.

Second, Create any necessary channels, and webhooks for each channel.

Third, Modify the bot files and input the right information - ie: bot token, channel names, colors, etc.
